                <p>I have been making websites since I was in the first grade. One of the first websites I made was for my teacher to post our what our homework was and when it was due. Since then, I have made websites for many differnet groups that I have been a part of, from fraternities to marching bands.</p>
               <br/>
                <p>I enjoy creating things that people can interact with. To me, the internet is for exploring and getting lost in.</p>
               <br />
               <p>In my freetime, I can be found composing music for schools around the world to perform, and taking care of two cats.</p>
